# How to Use Flyte — AutoE2E Pipeline UI Guide

A practical, screen-by-screen guide to the Flyte Console for the AutoE2E training
platform. Organized by **what you want to do**, so you can jump straight to your use case.

- **Flyte Console**: https://d1fk8c95f6ice9.cloudfront.net/console
- **Login**: Cognito-protected. Credentials are shared with **Core Contributors only** —
  ask **Ryota Yamada** for access. You will be redirected to a Cognito login page first.
- **Project**: `auto-e2e` · **Domain**: `development`

> For task internals and parameters, see `flyte_workflow_parameters.md`.
> This document focuses on **navigating the UI**.
> The trajectory-overlay production path is ops-only and uses a VPC-local
> CodeBuild launcher; see Use case G.

---

## 0. First time: logging in and finding the project

1. Open https://d1fk8c95f6ice9.cloudfront.net/console
2. You are redirected to the Cognito hosted login. Sign in with the credentials
   provided to Core Contributors (ask **Ryota Yamada** — they are never stored in git).
3. You land on the Flyte Console home. Top-left, make sure the **Project** selector
   shows **`auto-e2e`** and the **Domain** selector shows **`development`**.
   (Other Flyte sample projects were archived, so `auto-e2e` should be the only one.)
4. The left sidebar has three main sections you will use:
   - **Workflows** — the DAGs you can launch
   - **Tasks** — individual reusable steps
   - **Executions** — the history of every run

---

## Core concepts (30-second version)

| Term | What it is | Where in UI |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Task** | One containerized step (e.g. `train_il`) | Tasks tab |
| **Workflow** | A DAG wiring tasks together (e.g. `wf_full_pipeline`) | Workflows tab |
| **Launch Plan** | A runnable, versioned binding of a workflow + default inputs | "Launch Workflow" button |
| **Execution** | One actual run of a launch plan | Executions tab |
| **Node** | One task instance inside a running execution (n0, n1, …) | Inside an execution |

---

## Use case A — "I want to train a model end-to-end"

**You are**: an ML engineer who wants a full ingest → train → evaluate run.

**Workflow to use**: `wf_full_pipeline`

### Steps
1. Sidebar → **Workflows** → click **`workflows.wf_full_pipeline`**.
2. Top-right → **Launch Workflow**.
3. A form appears with the inputs. Fill in:
   - **`dataset`** (dropdown): `yaak-ai/L2D` or `nvidia/PhysicalAI-Autonomous-Vehicles`
     — which processed dataset to actually train on.
   - **`backbone`** (dropdown): `swin_v2_tiny` / `conv_next_v2_tiny` / `res_net_50`
   - **`epochs_il`**, **`epochs_rl`**, **`batch_size`**, **`lr`**, **`tau`**, **`beta`**, **`episodes`** — numbers, defaults are fine for a smoke run.

   There is no `fusion_mode` input: BEV fusion is hardcoded in the model since
   PR #94 (concat / cross_attn were removed). To run IL without the memory-hungry
   offline-RL step, launch **`workflows.wf_ingest_train_eval`** instead.
   - **No `hf_token` field** — the HF token is injected from a Kubernetes Secret.
4. Click **Launch**. You are taken to the new **execution** page.

### What you will see while it runs
- A **graph (DAG) view** with nodes: `n0 … n7`.
- Nodes light up Pending → Running → Succeeded.
- Both datasets are ingested + processed in parallel (you will see two ingest and
  two processing nodes running side by side), then the selected dataset flows into
  training and evaluation.

### When it finishes
- The execution badge turns **Succeeded** (green).
- Jump to **MLflow** to read the metrics (see Use case D).

---

## Use case B — "I just want to (re)build the dataset shards"

**You are**: someone iterating on preprocessing, or preparing data before training.

**Workflows**: `wf_data_ingest`, then `wf_data_processing`

### Steps
1. **Workflows → `wf_data_ingest` → Launch Workflow**.
   - Set `dataset` and `episodes`. Launch.
   - When it succeeds, open the execution → **Outputs** tab → copy the
     `FlyteDirectory` URI (the raw dataset cache).
2. **Workflows → `wf_data_processing` → Launch Workflow**.
   - Paste the raw URI into **`raw_data`**.
   - Set `dataset`, `hz`, `image_size`, `episodes`. Launch.
   - Output is a `FlyteDirectory` of WebDataset `.tar` shards + `manifest.json`.

### How to read the output URI
- Open the execution → **Nodes** → click the task node → **Outputs** panel.
- Each `FlyteDirectory` / `FlyteFile` shows an `s3://…` URI you can reuse as input
  to a later workflow.

---

## Use case C — "I have shards already and just want to train / refine"

**You are**: someone who already has processed shards and wants to skip ingest.

**Workflows**: `wf_train_il`, then `wf_train_offline_rl`

### IL training
1. **Workflows → `wf_train_il` → Launch Workflow**.
2. **`shards`** is a **list of `FlyteDirectory`** — add one entry per dataset's
   processed shard dir (paste the URIs from Use case B). The task picks the one
   matching **`dataset`**.
3. Set `backbone`, `epochs`, `batch_size`, `lr`. Launch.
4. Output: a `TrainOutput` with `checkpoint` and `metadata` FlyteFiles
   (grab their URIs from the Outputs panel).

### Offline-RL refinement
1. **Workflows → `wf_train_offline_rl` → Launch Workflow**.
2. Fill:
   - **`pretrained`**: the IL `checkpoint` URI.
   - **`il_metadata`**: the IL `metadata` URI.
   - **`shards`**: same list of shard dirs.
   - **`dataset`**, `epochs`, `tau`, `beta`.
3. Launch. It refines the IL policy with IQL and runs `evaluate_rl_policy`.

---

## Use case D — "I want to see results / compare experiments"

**You are**: anyone evaluating model quality.

Flyte shows **execution status**; **MLflow** shows **metrics**. Use both.

### In Flyte (did it run? where did it fail?)
1. Sidebar → **Executions**. The list shows every run with status, start time, duration.
2. Click an execution to open the DAG. Red node = failure.
3. Click a failed node → **Logs** (Kubernetes logs) and the error message panel.

### In MLflow (how good is the model?)
1. Open https://d33520viyb0smg.cloudfront.net/
2. Pick an experiment:
   - **`imitation-learning`** — IL runs (logged by `evaluate_il_policy`)
   - **`offline-rl`** — RL-refined runs (logged by `evaluate_rl_policy`)
3. The run table shows one row per run. Key columns:
   - `model/backbone`, `model/fusion_mode`, `data/dataset`
   - `eval/ade`, `eval/fde`, `eval/gate_pass`
   - `train/lr`, `train/epochs`, etc.
4. Select multiple runs → **Compare** to overlay loss curves and compare params.
5. Each run also stores `config.yaml` + the checkpoint as **artifacts**, and the
   model is registered under **`auto-e2e-driving-policy`** in the Model Registry.

---

## Use case E — "Something failed. How do I debug?"

1. **Executions** → open the failed (red) execution.
2. In the DAG, find the red node. Note which task it is (`data_ingest`, `train_il`, …).
3. Click the node → right panel:
   - **Execution Details**: the error message (e.g. OOMKilled, ImagePullBackOff, a Python traceback).
   - **Logs**: live/last Kubernetes pod logs for that task.
   - **Inputs / Outputs**: the exact data the node received and produced.
4. Common failures and meaning:
   | Symptom | Likely cause |
   |---------|--------------|
   | `OOMKilled` (exit 137) | task needs more memory — raise `Resources(mem=…)` |
   | `ImagePullBackOff` | ECR image missing/wrong tag |
   | `exceeded quota: project-quota` | namespace ResourceQuota too small |
   | `WebIdentityErr / AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` | Flyte S3 auth not on access-key |
   | `Bus error / shared memory` | DataLoader `num_workers` too high for `/dev/shm` |
5. Fix the root cause, then **Relaunch** (button on the execution page reuses the
   same inputs) or launch fresh from the workflow.

---

## Use case F — "I want to monitor a long-running training run"

1. Open the execution page. It **auto-refreshes**.
2. The **timeline / Gantt view** (toggle near the graph) shows how long each node
   takes and what is running now.
3. Click the running training node → **Logs** to watch epoch-by-epoch loss prints.
4. GPU nodes (`train_il`, `train_offline_rl`, eval tasks) may sit in
   **Pending / ContainerCreating** for 1–3 minutes while a GPU node is provisioned
   by EKS Auto Mode — this is normal.

---

## Use case G — "I want to publish v2.1 and precompute Console overlays"

**You are**: a platform operator publishing an immutable dataset snapshot and
precomputing one registered model's canonical trajectory overlays.

**Workflows**:

- Smoke: `wf_create_publish_and_precompute_overlays`
- Production after training: `wf_publish_full_run_overlays`

The DataModelConsole never invokes these workflows. Launch them through the
VPC-local CodeBuild project so Flyte registration and every task image use ECR
digests rather than mutable tags.

### Prepare the tested source and images

Run these commands from the tested feature-branch checkout:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=autowarefoundation
export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
CACHE_BUCKET="auto-e2e-platform-codebuild-cache-${ACCOUNT_ID}"
IMAGE_TAG="trajectory-$(git rev-parse --short=12 HEAD)"

git archive --format=zip --output=/tmp/auto-e2e-source.zip HEAD
aws s3 cp /tmp/auto-e2e-source.zip "s3://${CACHE_BUCKET}/source.zip"

aws codebuild start-build \
  --project-name auto-e2e-platform-build-images \
  --environment-variables-override \
    "name=IMAGE_TAG,value=${IMAGE_TAG},type=PLAINTEXT"
```

Wait for the image build to reach `SUCCEEDED`, then register the same tag:

```bash
aws codebuild start-build \
  --project-name auto-e2e-platform-flyte-register \
  --environment-variables-override \
    "name=IMAGE_TAG,value=${IMAGE_TAG},type=PLAINTEXT"
```

The commit-derived tag keeps active workflows that still reference `latest`
unchanged. Registration and launch resolve the selected `training`, `eval`,
`offline-rl`, and `data-prep` tags to ECR digests. The launcher also recomputes
the preprocessing and inference source digests inside the source bundle; Flyte
tasks reject any mismatch at runtime.

### Launch the one-episode smoke

Choose an immutable numeric version from the MLflow registered model
`auto-e2e-driving-policy`; do not use a moving alias.

```bash
MODEL_VERSION=30  # Example only; replace with the version you selected.
aws codebuild start-build \
  --project-name auto-e2e-platform-overlay-launch \
  --environment-variables-override \
    "name=MODEL_VERSION,value=${MODEL_VERSION},type=PLAINTEXT" \
    "name=IMAGE_TAG,value=${IMAGE_TAG},type=PLAINTEXT"
```

The launcher defaults to `EPISODES=1`, `DATASET_VERSION=v2.1`, and
`BASE_SEEDS=[0]`. It derives a `kitscenes-smoke-<digest>` publication name from
the data contract, inference code, image, source revision, and smoke size. This
keeps the smoke snapshot separate from the write-once production coordinate.

CodeBuild prints the remote Flyte execution. In Flyte Console, open
**Executions** and inspect the newest
`wf_create_publish_and_precompute_overlays` run. The high-level order is:

```text
wf_create_dataset_sharded
  -> wf_publish_dataset_snapshot
  -> wf_precompute_overlays
  -> overlay manifest
  -> OVLSET building-to-ready gate
```

Treat the smoke as successful only when the Flyte execution succeeds and the
Console can read the published model overlay. A CodeBuild `SUCCEEDED` status
only confirms that the remote execution was submitted.

### Publish a completed Full Run

Wait for `wf_sharded_full_run` to reach `SUCCEEDED`, then pass that execution ID.
Do not pass `MODEL_VERSION`: the production workflow resolves the exact MLflow
model whose `ctx/train_execution_id` matches the Full Run.

```bash
FULL_RUN_EXECUTION_ID=<SUCCEEDED_FLYTE_EXECUTION_ID>
aws codebuild start-build \
  --project-name auto-e2e-platform-overlay-launch \
  --environment-variables-override \
    "name=FULL_RUN_EXECUTION_ID,value=${FULL_RUN_EXECUTION_ID},type=PLAINTEXT" \
    "name=IMAGE_TAG,value=${IMAGE_TAG},type=PLAINTEXT" \
    "name=PUBLISHED_DATASET,value=kitscenes,type=PLAINTEXT"
```

The launcher fails closed unless the execution is the successful
`wf_sharded_full_run` for KITScenes `v2.1`, used `episodes=0`, generated reasoning
labels, and trained with reasoning and world-model branches enabled. It reads the
nested `wf_create_dataset_sharded` `List[FlyteDirectory]` output directly from
Flyte Admin, so it does not ingest, relabel, or repack the corpus. Inside Flyte,
the model resolver checks the source dataset/version and the Full Run execution
ID again before publication.

The production coordinate is `kitscenes/v2.1`. Publication copies the existing
labeled shard artifacts, then canonical overlay inference uses the Full Run
checkpoint, and the ready gate is written last.

### Materialize reasoning serving rows

Wait for `wf_publish_full_run_overlays` itself, not only its CodeBuild launcher,
to reach `SUCCEEDED`. Its named outputs are:

- `overlay_result`: the ready canonical overlay set
- `manifest_key`: the immutable publication manifest key
- `manifest_sha256`: SHA-256 of the exact manifest bytes

Use the latter two outputs to run the separately guarded Console Job. The Job
uses the Console API Pod Identity because the Flyte and CodeBuild roles do not
have the required DynamoDB `BatchWriteItem` permission.

```bash
source console-images.env
export AWS_PROFILE=autowarefoundation
export EXPECTED_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=<PLATFORM_ACCOUNT_ID>
export PUBLISHED_DATASET=kitscenes
export DATASET_VERSION=v2.1
export MANIFEST_KEY=<FLYTE_manifest_key_OUTPUT>
export MANIFEST_SHA256=<FLYTE_manifest_sha256_OUTPUT>

DRY_RUN=true \
  Tools/DataModelConsole/deploy/run-reasoning-materialization.sh

export CONFIRM_PRODUCTION_MATERIALIZATION=yes
Tools/DataModelConsole/deploy/run-reasoning-materialization.sh
```

The launcher re-reads the manifest from S3 and verifies its digest before
creating a `batch/v1 Job`. Monitor the generated Job to completion. A failed or
interrupted run holds a 15-minute fencing lease; do not immediately start a
second run. Normal `deploy/apply.sh` never launches this Job.

### Retry and immutability rules

- Retrying the exact same model, source, image, seeds, and contract is
  idempotent. Existing compatible S3 objects and DynamoDB records are reused.
- A conflicting body or identity at the same model/dataset/version/schema
  coordinate fails; it is never overwritten.
- Do not change `BASE_SEEDS`, the model artifact, or inference contract after a
  coordinate is ready. Publish a new dataset/schema coordinate for an
  intentional canonical-result change.
- The ready gate is written last. A failed or `building` set is not advertised
  by the Console, and retrying a ready set never moves it back to `building`.

---

## Use case H — "I want an MP4 report for an overlay shard"

**Workflow**: `wf_export_trajectory_report`

Use this after the overlay set is `ready`. It is a CPU-only optional export and
does not load the model checkpoint or run inference again.

1. Copy one published shard URI from the dataset manifest.
2. Copy its matching `overlay.bin.gz` URI from the overlay manifest or DynamoDB
   pointer.
3. In Flyte Console, launch `wf_export_trajectory_report`.
4. Set `shard` and `overlay` to those immutable S3 URIs. Optionally set
   `scene_uids`, `seed_index`, `camera_index`, and `max_frames_per_scene`.
5. Download the returned `FlyteDirectory`, which contains per-scene MP4 files,
   thumbnails, metrics, and `manifest.json`.

The task joins predictions by `sample_uid` and rejects a shard/overlay mismatch.
It is cached by immutable input URI and report schema.

---

## Reading the DAG of `wf_full_pipeline`

```
n0 data_ingest(L2D)        n2 data_ingest(NVIDIA)     ← run in parallel
        │                          │
n1 data_processing(L2D)    n3 data_processing(NVIDIA) ← run in parallel
        └───────────┬──────────────┘
                    ▼  (both shard dirs passed; dataset arg selects one)
            n4 train_il
                    ▼
            n5 evaluate_il_policy   → MLflow: imitation-learning
                    ▼
            n6 train_offline_rl
                    ▼
            n7 evaluate_rl_policy   → MLflow: offline-rl
```
(Node numbering can vary; hover a node to see its task name.)

## Tips

- **Launch Plan versions**: every `pyflyte register` creates a new version. The UI
  defaults to the latest. If you need an exact version, pick it from the version
  dropdown on the workflow page.
- **Inputs are immutable per execution**: to change a parameter, launch a new run.
- **Outputs are addressable**: any node's output `s3://…` URI can be fed as input to
  another workflow — this is how you chain `wf_data_processing` → `wf_train_il` manually.
- **Secrets never appear in the UI**: the HF token is injected from the `hf-token`
  Kubernetes Secret and is not a workflow input, so it will not show up in any
  Inputs panel.
- **Archived clutter**: the default Flyte sample projects (`flytesnacks`, etc.) were
  archived so only `auto-e2e` is visible.
